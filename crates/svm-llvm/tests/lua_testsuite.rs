//! **Lua's own test suite** on the on-ramp — three unmodified files from the official Lua 5.4.7
//! distribution (`testes/vararg.lua`, `testes/bwcoercion.lua`, `testes/pm.lua`) run through the whole
//! VM with the base/`string`/`table`/`math`/`utf8` libraries open, each as its own chunk under
//! `pcall`. A Lua test signals failure by raising (an `assert`), which `pcall` catches, so a clean
//! **exit 0** means every `assert` in all three files held — identical to running them on native Lua
//! (the suite's own pass/fail contract). Byte-for-byte the same outcome on the tree-walker, bytecode,
//! and JIT.
//!
//! The fixture (`tests/fixtures/lua/lua_testsuite.bc`) links the Lua core + those five libraries with
//! the guest libc shim, guest `libm`, guest `strtod` (incl. hex floats), the guest runtime `snprintf`,
//! and fdlibm inverse-trig/`modf` (`lua_testsuite_trig.c`) — see the fixtures README. The three files
//! were chosen because they are self-contained (no `require`/`os`/`io`/`debug`/`coroutine` and no
//! internal `T` test library): `vararg` exercises `...`/`select`/`table.unpack`; `bwcoercion` the
//! string↔number bitwise coercions with `_ENV = nil`; `pm` the full pattern-matching engine
//! (`find`/`match`/`gmatch`/`gsub`, captures, anchors, `%b`, `%f`).
