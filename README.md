# Sandbox VM

[![CI](https://github.com/thesherwood/vm/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thesherwood/vm/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A compilation target and sandbox VM: as secure (for the host) as WebAssembly,
faster than wasm on the interface / 64-bit-memory / startup axes, with a simpler and
more flexible interface, and real virtual memory.

The full design lives in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md); the working agreement (keep it
simple, commit to `main`, fuzz/test/bench early, data-oriented design) is in
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

> Status: **Phase 3 + cross-platform parity (3.5) complete, deep into Phase 4 (concurrency, nesting,
> durability, second/third frontends, tooling)** — the core loop, the Cranelift JIT, and the
> C frontend are all in place. The full **scalar IR** (integer /
> float ops, linear memory with confinement masking, direct / indirect / tail calls +
> the function table, `select`, `br_table`, `unreachable`) plus **capabilities**
> (`cap.call` over a host-owned handle table, and the MVP powerbox — `Stream` / `Exit`
> / `Clock` / `Memory`, §3c/§3e) flow through text ⇄ binary ⇄ verifier ⇄ reference
> interpreter ⇄ JIT, with the masking unit isolated and fuzzed, and a **generative
> interpreter-vs-JIT differential fuzzer** (a verifier-valid IR generator → both backends
> must agree on result + trap; stable-CI seed loop + a libFuzzer `diff` target). The
> **Cranelift JIT** (§9)
> now lowers the **entire IR** — integer/float ops, conversions, the §4 memory
> **masking lowering** (I1), function-table **indirect-call dispatch** (I2), direct/
> indirect/tail calls, trap detection, and **`cap.call` through a host thunk** — all
> **differential-tested against the interpreter** oracle (§18), including trap kinds and
> host side effects. A **C frontend** (`frontend/chibicc`, a vendored chibicc fork with an
> `--emit-ir` backend, §3d) compiles a broad C subset — ints/longs/floats, locals,
> pointers, arrays, structs/unions, globals & string literals (incl. **pointer
> initializers / relocations** — `char *p = "..."`, `&global`, function-pointer tables),
> the full operator set
> incl. short-circuit `&&`/`||`/`?:`, `if`/`while`/`for`/`do`/`switch` with
> `break`/`continue` and **general `goto`/labels**, functions and **recursion** (via a threaded data-stack pointer),
> **function pointers** (a function designator decays to its `ref.func` index; `fp(args)`
> lowers to `call_indirect` through the function table, I2), **by-value structs/unions**
> (passed by hidden pointer, returned via `sret`, D39; whole-aggregate assignment),
> **varargs + a guest-C `printf`** over the powerbox, and **`malloc`/`free`** (a guest
> allocator that grows the window via the Memory capability — the shipped `<stdlib.h>`) — all of
> which **verify and run identically on the interpreter and the
> JIT**, hello-world and a heap-allocated linked list included (the §18 Phase-2 "it works"
> milestone). The §3d **SSA-promotion pass** lifts non-address-taken scalar locals out of
> memory into SSA values (threaded as block params), so the JIT register-allocates them — a
> hot loop body drops from ~22 load/store ops to zero. **Production trap-catching** runs across
> **Linux / macOS / Windows**: a reserved window with a guard page + a fault handler (unix
> SIGSEGV/SIGBUS + `siglongjmp`; Windows VEH) turns an out-of-window fault into a clean
> `MemoryFault` (§4/§5 detect-and-kill), and the large
> reserved-window model is the default; **read-only data segments** (§3a/D40) and a real
> **Memory capability** (`map`/`unmap`/`protect`/`page_size`) exist — including **guest-controlled growth**
> into the reserved tail (the §1a sparse-address-space / lazy-page-supply differentiator: a guest
> `map`s pages anywhere in its large reserved window, the kernel demand-pages them, and an
> uncommitted access faults), backed by real `mprotect` and differentially fuzzed against the
> interpreter — and exposed to C as the **default guest `malloc`** (the shipped `<stdlib.h>`): any
> program that `#include <stdlib.h>` gets a `malloc`/`free`/`calloc`/`realloc` whose heap grows
> megabytes past the initial window through the Memory capability, byte-identically to native `cc`
> (`demos/heapgrow`). **Concurrency primitives** have landed (§12; x86-64 + aarch64 unix and
> x86-64 Windows): stackful
> **fibers** (`cont.*`), **threads** (`thread.spawn`/`join`, **1:1** — one vCPU per OS thread),
> **C11 atomics**, and a **`wait`/`notify` futex** — the VM ships these as *primitives* with **no
> built-in scheduler** (D22/D56), and a C-compatible **`<pthread.h>`** (`create`/`join`/`mutex`/
> `cond`) is built over them in the libc, so multithreaded C runs identically on the interpreter
> (the deterministic interleaving oracle, `explore_all`) and the JIT (real OS threads).
> **§14 nesting (VM-in-VM) has landed on both backends**: a guest holding an **`Instantiator`**
> capability carves a power-of-two **sub-window** and spawns a child domain there — confinement
> composes recursively at depth-independent cost, an attenuable **`AddressSpace`** capability
> manages pages, and **co-fiber** children (`spawn_coroutine`/`resume`/`yield`) cooperate with
> their parent, including **fault-driven yield** (`spawn_demand_coroutine`): a demand-paged child's
> first touch of a page suspends it to its parent, which supplies the page and resumes — real
> hardware lazy paging on the JIT (the fault handler suspends the child's fiber), prot-map faults
> on the interpreter, byte-identical by differential. **Separate-module nested children** are in
> too: the host grants a **`Module` capability** for a different verified module, and a guest
> instantiates it as a child domain — the plugin-in-plugin story, its data segments materialized
> into the carve (lazily, for demand-paged children). And **cross-domain `SharedRegion`
> `create`/`grant`** closes the §13/§14 data plane: a guest mints a shareable region via its
> `AddressSpace` and grants it into a child domain — parent and child then share bytes zero-copy.
> This reaches **all the way to C**: the powerbox grants `_start` an `AddressSpace` handle, and the
> libc exposes `<svm.h>` (`__vm_region_create`/`map`/`unmap`/`page_size`), so a stock C guest mints a
> region and maps it at two adjacent offsets to build the **magic ring buffer** (a single
> wrap-around access becomes one contiguous store) — verified end to end on both backends.
> The §5 **fuel/epoch kill-path** now exists on *both* backends: the interpreter bounds execution
> with its per-step fuel counter, and the JIT polls a host-owned interrupt cell at loop back-edges
> and function entries, so a host watchdog stops a **runaway guest** (infinite loop / unbounded
> recursion) with `OutOfFuel` instead of hanging — guest-undisableable, and exposed on the CLI via
> `SVM_DEADLINE_MS`. It kills a **whole multithreaded domain** from one interrupt: spinning vCPUs
> poll the shared cell, a vCPU parked in a futex `wait`/`join` re-checks it and unwinds too, and a
> runaway **nested §14 child** polls the parent's cell as well — so the kill reaches every JIT
> execution context (root, sibling vCPUs, nested children).
> The **async I/O ring** (§9/§12) has landed: an `IoRing` capability batches deferred `cap.call`s,
> a bounded host **offload pool** runs blocking ops concurrently, and `submit_async`/`reap` park a
> vCPU on an in-window futex counter that a pool worker wakes (an I/O completion *is* a futex
> notify) — driven end-to-end by an **async event-loop runtime in real C**, including an async
> **work-stealing M:N** scheduler that is *entirely guest code* over the two primitives (D56/D57).
> **Fibers are migratable (D57 complete, DESIGN §23):** `cont.resume` on any vCPU claims a suspended
> fiber and continues its *native stack* on that OS thread — a loom-verified single-owner protocol
> arbitrates racing claims, with an empirical net (randomized-migration interp↔JIT differential,
> ASan with real fiber-switch annotations, concurrent-steal stress) in place of unavailable expert
> review — capstoned by `demos/steal_fibers`, a guest **work-stealing scheduler over stackful
> tasks** that suspends from inside nested call frames (inexpressible for stackless state machines).
> A **second frontend, `svm-wasm`**, transpiles **core wasm → IR** (reconstructing SSA from the
> stack machine) and runs real clang-compiled programs and **real C libraries** — the jsmn JSON
> tokenizer and B-Con SHA-256 — byte-identically to native, including bulk memory
> (`memory.copy`/`fill`), `memory.grow`, **function imports** (a wasm `call` → a `cap.call`),
> **v128 SIMD** (a real `clang -msimd128 -O2` saxpy → first-class `v128` IR, ~1.0× Wasmtime), and
> **wasm threads** (`*.atomic.*` + shared/imported memory; the **wasi-threads** `wasi:thread/spawn`
> lowers to SVM's *native* `thread.spawn` — the same bytes `wasmtime-wasi-threads` runs, but
> concurrency *in* the VM: on a spawn-heavy parallel kernel SVM is **~1.35× faster** than
> Wasmtime+wasi-threads, parity on steady-state compute); it benches the §1a thesis on the *same
> bytes* Wasmtime runs. The host-call boundary is now
> **devirtualized** (D45): a `cap.call` to a statically-known capability op is a register-to-register
> direct call, taking `hostcall` from ~parity to ~1.5× faster than Wasmtime. And **§15 spawn
> quotas** — host-configurable fiber/vCPU ceilings enforced identically on both backends (CLI
> `SVM_MAX_FIBERS`/`SVM_MAX_VCPUS`) — contain a spawn-bomb (`FiberFault`/`ThreadFault`), DoS
> containment that complements the kill-path's bound on runaway execution.
> A **guest-driven JIT** (the **`Jit`** capability, §22) closes the "JIT inside the sandbox" gap wasm
> handles poorly: guest code (e.g. an interpreter) builds serialized SVM IR at runtime, hands the blob
> across `cap.call`, and the host **verifies** it (the same `decode`+`verify` gate every module passes,
> plus a memory-match precondition) and **Cranelift-compiles** it into the guest's *own* domain — same
> window, same powerbox; verification, not isolation, is the trust boundary. The compiled unit is reached
> by `invoke` (a trampoline) or, once `install`ed into the `call_indirect` table, as a first-class
> **funcref** at native speed (all four old↔new cross-call directions differentially pinned). It runs
> end-to-end **from C** (`<svm.h>`: `__vm_jit_compile`/`invoke2`/`install`/…): a guest bytecode interpreter
> that **JITs itself** (`demos/jit/jit_demo.c`). Long REPL sessions don't exhaust the code arena —
> `JitSession` does **whole-module compaction** on a byte watermark (cranelift-jit has no per-function
> free), transparently — and worker threads can **compile concurrently** (a per-domain `Mutex<Host>`
> serializes compiles while execution stays parallel), with full platform parity. All on **both backends,
> differentially identical**.
> Beyond the runtime, several **frontends and tooling subsystems** have landed (each with its own
> design doc):
> a second-and-a-half frontend, **`svm-llvm`** — an **LLVM-bitcode → IR** translator (the AOT LLVM
> on-ramp, D54/§20a; `LLVM.md`) that runs `clang -O2 -emit-llvm` output and clears its exit criterion
> (all chibicc corpus libraries byte-identical to native on both backends); **durable domains**
> (`svm-durable` + `svm-snapshot`, D60/§21; `DURABILITY.md`) — an IR→IR **freeze/thaw** transform plus
> a backend-independent, recompile-survivable **snapshot codec**, so a running domain can be quiesced,
> serialized, and restored bytewise (single- and multi-vCPU, both backends); **time-travel-capable
> debugging** (`svm-dap`, §19; `DEBUGGING.md`) — an interpreter-backed **Debug Adapter Protocol**
> server (breakpoints / stepping / backtrace / source-level locals over the IR debug info, no DWARF/JIT
> needed); **memory-access instrumentation hooks** (§19; `HOOKS.md`) — an opt-in, **zero-cost-when-off**
IR→IR pass that fires an embedder hook (observe or veto) around every guest memory op, identical across
all three backends, for memory-safety validation and cache/page-fault scoring; a **partial evaluator**
(`svm-peval`, §20c) — a semantics-preserving IR→IR
> optimizer plus the first **Futamura projection** (specialize an interpreter + fixed program into a
> residual); a minimal **WASI preview1** host shim (`svm-wasi`, §7) over the `svm-wasm` import
> mechanism; **conservative-GC support** (`gc.roots` control-stack root enumeration for a guest's own
> collector, `GC.md`); and the **interpreter-as-wasm browser build** (`browser/`, §21; `BROWSER.md`) —
> the bytecode engine compiled to **wasm64** so SVM guests run client-side.
> Still ahead:
> narrow-scalar promotion, honoring *weak* memory orderings (both backends seq-cst today), wider SIMD
> (`v256`/`v512` — fixed-128 `v128` is done across all backends, D58), isolation tiers, Spectre
> hardening, source-level **DWARF** for JIT-compiled code, and broadening LLVM/wasm frontend coverage.
> This is a research build; "appears to work" is reachable, "is certified secure" is an explicit
> post-MVP workstream (see `DESIGN.md` §2a/§18).

## Layout

| Crate | Role | TCB? |
|---|---|---|
| `svm-ir` | Core IR: block-local typed SSA over a CFG (§3a/§3b) | escape-TCB |
| `svm-mask` | Confinement masking — the isolated, separately-fuzzed unit (§4, I1) | escape-TCB |
| `svm-mem` | Shared guest-memory substrate (§12/§13) — owns the memory `unsafe` behind a safe API (audited in isolation, like `svm-mask`), so the interpreter stays `forbid(unsafe_code)` | escape-TCB |
| `svm-encode` | Binary encode + **decode** (untrusted-input-facing) (§3a) | escape-TCB |
| `svm-verify` | The verifier — single linear pass, fail-closed (§2a I2/I3/I4; §3b) | escape-TCB |
| `svm-interp` | Two of the three IR backends: the **tree-walk interpreter** (the differential oracle, §18) and the **bytecode interpreter** (`bytecode.rs` — the JIT-not-viable / wasm64 fallback). All three backends must agree (§3 parity invariant) | — |
| `svm-fiber` | Native stack-switch primitive for fibers / green threads (§3d/§6/§12); the lone home for that `unsafe`, tiny and auditable (x86-64 + aarch64 unix, x86-64 Windows) | escape-TCB |
| `svm-jit` | Cranelift JIT — CLIF lowering + the §4 masking lowering + guard page/signal (§9) | escape-TCB† |
| `svm-text` | Text format ⇄ IR (dev/debug; 1:1 with binary) (§3a) | — |
| `svm-wasm` | **Core-wasm → IR transpiler** — a second frontend (untrusted, re-verified); stack→SSA reconstruction (`WASM.md`) | — |
| `svm-llvm` | **LLVM-bitcode → IR translator** — the AOT LLVM on-ramp (untrusted, re-verified); dominance-SSA → block-args (§20a, D54; `LLVM.md`) | — |
| `svm-wasi` | Minimal **WASI preview1** host shim (`fd_write`/`proc_exit`) over the `svm-wasm` import mechanism (§7) | — (host shim) |
| `svm-peval` | **Partial evaluator** — semantics-preserving IR→IR optimizer + the first Futamura projection (§20c) | — |
| `svm-durable` | IR→IR **freeze/thaw** transform for durable domains (tooling-tier, +0 TCB; §21, D60; `DURABILITY.md`) | — |
| `svm-snapshot` | Durable-domain **snapshot artifact codec** (window image + handle table + identity gate; §21; `DURABILITY.md`) | — |
| `svm-dap` | Interpreter-backed **Debug Adapter Protocol** server (breakpoints/stepping/locals; §19; `DEBUGGING.md`) | — |
| `svm` | Umbrella: pipeline (`assemble`/`load`/`run`) + tests + bench | — |
| `svm-run` | Embedding runtime + **`svm-run` CLI**: instantiate with the powerbox, run on the JIT | — |
| `browser/` | The bytecode interpreter compiled to **wasm64** — run SVM guests client-side (`BROWSER.md`) | — |
| `fuzz/` | cargo-fuzz targets (nightly); mirror the stable smoke fuzz | — |

†`svm-jit` is escape-TCB but, by design (§1), shares Wasmtime's codegen — so unlike
the other TCB crates it *does* take a dependency (Cranelift). The dependency-free rule
covers only the small audit-critical crates (`svm-ir`/`svm-mask`/`svm-encode`/`svm-verify`).

The escape-TCB crates are deliberately **dependency-free** (small, fast to compile,
auditable). The host is Rust; the frontend (`frontend/chibicc`) is C; codegen lowers to
Cranelift (`DESIGN.md` D49 / D36).

## Build & test

```sh
cargo build --workspace
cargo test  --workspace          # pipeline + differential + 250k-iter smoke fuzz
cargo fmt   --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
cargo run --release --bin svm-bench   # decode / verify / interp throughput
```

## Run a program in the sandbox

The `svm-run` CLI compiles (if needed), verifies, and runs a guest program on the JIT under
the MVP powerbox (§3e) — `stdout`/`stderr` go to the real streams and it exits with the
guest's code:

```sh
cargo run -p svm-run -- crates/svm-run/demos/hello.svm   # text IR → "hello, sandbox!"
cargo run -p svm-run -- crates/svm-run/demos/hello.c     # C source (via the chibicc frontend)

cargo run -p svm-run -- crates/svm-run/demos/steal_fibers/steal_fibers.c         # work-stealing over migratable stackful fibers (D57)
cargo run -p svm-run -- crates/svm-run/demos/malloc_threads/malloc_threads.c     # concurrent malloc from many vCPUs (thread-safe heap)
cargo run -p svm-run -- crates/svm-run/demos/async_io/async_io.c                 # async event loop over the §9/§12 I/O ring
cargo run -p svm-run -- crates/svm-run/demos/async_work_stealing/async_work_stealing.c # async work-stealing M:N runtime (capstone)
echo 'int main(){ return 42; }' > /tmp/r.c
cargo run -p svm-run -- /tmp/r.c ; echo "exit $?"        # → exit 42
```

`calc.c` (recursion + a function-pointer dispatch table) and `rational.c` (by-value
struct args/returns through direct and indirect calls) are larger real programs, each
checked byte-for-byte against a native `cc` build in `svm-run`'s tests. **`clay/clay_demo.c`
runs the real-world [Clay](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay) UI layout library** (a ~5k-line
third-party C header, vendored) sandboxed: it compiles through the frontend to ~93k lines of
IR, verifies, and runs on the JIT, producing the same render commands as a native build.
Getting it to run drove a batch of frontend/IR/JIT fixes (anonymous-aggregate designated
inits, ternary-returns-struct, >16-byte struct returns, mixed-width shifts, program-sized
windows, a contiguous JIT code arena, gcc-parity packed-enum/struct layout) — see `FRONTEND.md`.
**`jsmn/jsmn_demo.c`** runs the [jsmn](https://github.com/zserge/jsmn) zero-allocation JSON
tokenizer — a different shape (char/state-machine string scanning) that ran identically to a
native build with no new fixes, validating string handling, escapes, nesting, and error paths.
**`sha256/sha_demo.c`** runs Brad Conte's public-domain SHA-256 — the pure integer/bit shape
(32-bit wrapping arithmetic, rotates-as-shifts, a round-key table) — matching the standard test
vectors; it flushed a `func_index` null-token crash on undefined-function calls (now a clean error).
**`xxhash/xxh_demo.c`** runs [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash)'s scalar XXH32/XXH64
against the standard vectors; it added `_Static_assert` (C11) support to the frontend.
**`tinfl/tinfl_demo.c`** runs [miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz)'s `tinfl` DEFLATE/zlib
*inflate* engine — a coroutine-style state machine (a deeply nested `switch`, bit-buffer shifts,
Huffman tables, a 32 KiB LZ77 dictionary inside the decompressor struct); it inflates an embedded
zlib stream byte-identically to a native build, with no new fixes.
**`perlin/perlin_demo.c`** runs [stb_perlin](https://github.com/nothings/stb) (Sean Barrett's 3D
Perlin noise) — the first **floating-point-heavy** shakedown (dense f32 gradient dot products, the
quintic ease polynomial, trilinear lerps, int↔float conversion, octave multiply/accumulate); it
prints fixed-point-scaled noise so any f32 divergence would show in the digits, and it matches a
native build byte-for-byte.
**`regex/regex_demo.c`** runs [tiny-regex-c](https://github.com/kokke/tiny-regex-c) — a
Rob-Pike-style **backtracking** matcher (`re_match` recurses through
`matchpattern`/`matchstar`/`matchplus`, retrying on failure), a new control-flow shape that
exercises data-stack threading and goto/branch lowering; it matches a native build with no new
fixes.
**`heapgrow/heapgrow.c`** **consumes the Memory capability** through plain `#include <stdlib.h>`:
the shipped guest libc's `malloc` grows its heap into the reserved tail on demand via the
`__vm_map` builtin (`cap.call` on the granted Memory handle). It allocates 1 MiB — ~16× its initial
window — and runs byte-identically to a native build, demonstrating the §1a "large/sparse programs"
path from portable C (nothing in the source is SVM-specific).

Accepts `.svm` (text IR), `.svmb` (binary), or `.c` (compiled through `frontend/chibicc`,
located via `$SVM_CHIBICC` or the in-repo build). Embedders can call the same path directly —
`svm_run::run_powerbox(&module, stdin)` returns the outcome plus captured output; it is the one
reusable host glue (the `cap.call` trampoline + powerbox grant), not escape-TCB (the verifier,
run first, is what makes a module safe).

## Fuzzing

Stable CI runs the smoke fuzz as ordinary tests (`crates/svm/tests/fuzz_smoke.rs`,
`spec_fuzz_smoke.rs`). For coverage-guided fuzzing (nightly):

```sh
cargo install cargo-fuzz
cargo +nightly fuzz run decode_verify   # decode/verify/interp never crash
cargo +nightly fuzz run mask            # the confinement-masking invariant (I1)
cargo +nightly fuzz run roundtrip       # binary + text round-trip identity
cargo +nightly fuzz run diff            # interp-vs-JIT differential (§18)
cargo +nightly fuzz run spec_ops        # every backend matches the executable spec's eval (SPEC.md)
cargo +nightly fuzz run spec_verify     # svm-verify vs the reference verifier agree (SPEC.md)
```

Invariants under test (the security hinge, §2a/§4): on arbitrary bytes, `decode`
fails closed (never panics/OOMs/hangs), `verify` never panics, any *verified* module
is safe to interpret, the masking unit confines every access into its window, and
the formats round-trip without changing the IR. The two `spec_*` targets extend the
executable ISA spec (`SPEC.md`) from its deterministic boundary lattices into
unbounded exploration: `spec_ops` drives random operand values through each op and
checks all three backends against the spec's reference semantics, and `spec_verify`
holds the production verifier and the independent reference verifier in accept/reject
agreement over generated + mutated modules.

## Example IR (text form)

```text
func (i32) -> (i32) {
block0(v0: i32):
  v1 = i32.const 0
  br block1(v0, v1)
block1(v2: i32, v3: i32):     ; v2 = i, v3 = sum
  v4 = i32.add v3 v2
  v5 = i32.const -1
  v6 = i32.add v2 v5
  br_if v6 block1(v6, v4) block2(v4)
block2(v7: i32):
  return v7                   ; sum of 1..=N
}
```
