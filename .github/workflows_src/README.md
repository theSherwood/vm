# workflows_src — the editable mirror of `.github/workflows/`

The CI token used by agent sessions cannot push files under `.github/workflows/`
(GitHub requires the `workflow` OAuth scope). This directory is the workaround:
agents edit workflow files **here**, and the repo owner applies them by copying
the directory over:

```sh
cp .github/workflows_src/*.yml .github/workflows/
```

(then commit and push with owner credentials). Keep the two in sync in that
direction only — `workflows_src` is the source of truth for *pending* changes;
`.github/workflows/` is what actually runs. After a copy-over the two are
identical until the next agent edit.

## Pending changes not yet copied over

_(none — `workflows_src` and `.github/workflows/` are in sync.)_

Remove entries from this list when they land in `.github/workflows/`.
